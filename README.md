Who doesn't like a good puzzle?
I made this mainly as an exercise for learning code.  My learning goals:
- familiarize myself with the HTML 5 canvas.
- organize code into ES6 classes.
- challenge myself with the game logic.

## Built With

ES6 Javascript, HTML 5 canvas, bootstrap.

## Getting Started

Enter the board width in squares and click 'new game'.  Slide pieces by clicking them so that you get the numbers in order from left to right in rows.  It doesn't matter where the empty square ends up.

### Prerequisites

Chrome browser


### Installing

open index.html


### Completed Features


- [x] A random puzzle is generated.
- [x] Slide pieces by clicking on them.

### Next Steps
